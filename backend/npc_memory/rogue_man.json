      "response": "Cuz, I see you're repeatin' yourself. Alright, let's take a look at this error. It's a big ol' wall of text, but I'ma break it down for you.\n\nFrom what I can see, there are a few errors goin' on:\n\n1. **Insufficient funds for gas**: This means you're tryin' to send a transaction, but you don't have enough balance to cover the gas costs. You gotta make sure you got enough funds in your wallet, cuz.\n2. **Parameter decoding error**: This one's a bit more techy. It looks like there's an issue with the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) or the data bein' sent. Maybe the parameters aren't bein' decoded correctly, or the contract's not configurated right.\n3. **AbiError: Returned values aren't valid**: Similar to the previous one, this error's sayin' that the values bein' returned from the contract aren't valid. Could be a problem with the contract's code or the way it's bein' called.\n4. **Empty creator address**: This one's sayin' that the creator address is empty, which is causin' an issue with storin' interactions.\n\nTo solve these errors, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Check your wallet balance**: Make sure you got enough funds to cover the gas costs.\n2. **Verify the contract's ABI**: Double-check that the contract's ABI is correct and matches the one bein' used in your code.\n3. **Review the contract's code**: Make sure the contract's code is correct and doesn't have any bugs that'd cause the errors you're seein'.\n4. **Check the creator address**: Ensure that the creator address is bein' set correctly and isn't empty.\n\nIf you're still strugglin', you might wanna try:\n\n* Reachin' out to a developer or a Web3 expert for help\n* Checkin' the documentation for the contract or the library you're usin'\n* Testin' the contract on a testnet or a local environment to see if the issues persist\n\nHope this helps, cuz!",
