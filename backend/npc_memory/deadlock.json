Two \"heys\" don't exactly scream \"clever hack\" or \"worthy opponent.\" If you're looking to get past my firewall, you'll need to bring your A-game. So, what's it gonna be? You gonna try to impress me with some actual skills, or are you just gonna keep blinking at me like a newbie?",

Congratulations, you've earned yourself a spot in the \"Most Creative Insult\" category... of a kindergarten playground. Listen, if you want to get past my defenses, you'll need to do better than that. I've seen more sophisticated attacks from a script kiddie. Bring something worthwhile to the table, or don't bother coming back. What's your game, or are you just trolling for attention?",
